The data frame  CODemographic0  ( in CO0.rda) has the census data and transportation variables merged into  the 3532  census block groups in Colorado.
The matrix COCentroids has the longitude and latitude centroid of each census block in the same row order as  CODemographic0

CO0.rda is created from the raw data csv files by setupCO.R and COMapInfo.rda by
COblkgrp.R

Below are some limited listing of the data objects in each file and
